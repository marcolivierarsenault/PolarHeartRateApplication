Polar Heart Rate Application
=========================

Android Application that displays data from a [Polar Heart Rate Monitor](http://www.polar.com/ca-en) connected by bluetooth.
The difference with other apps is that this one does not start a session or profile of any type for running or other sports,
it simply shows the data on screen so it can be seen quickly

You can download the app on Google play
